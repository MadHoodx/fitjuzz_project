## My Contributions

I was responsible for developing the **Guide Module**, one of the main features of the application.  
This module provides categorized fitness and health information, split into multiple components:

- **Exercise Module**  
  - Built screens to display a list of individual fitness exercises with basic instructions.  
  - Inserted exercise data into MongoDB and implemented APIs to fetch and render the information in the app.  

- **Encyclopedia Module**  
  - Designed detail and listing screens for browsing categorized knowledge.  
  - Connected frontend components with backend services for data retrieval.  

- **Macro Module (Carb, Protein, Fat)**  
  - Created screens to display food categories, macronutrient details, and summaries.  
  - Integrated with MongoDB to store nutrition data and fetch it into the app.  

- **Steroids Module**  
  - Developed category, detail, and overview screens.  
  - Implemented backend endpoints to serve steroid-related content.  

- **Supplement Module**  
  - Built category and detail pages for supplements.  
  - Integrated database queries for supplement information.  

### Tech Responsibilities
- **Frontend**: Implemented React/React Native components and screen navigation.  
- **Backend**: Designed MongoDB schemas, inserted data, and connected APIs for dynamic rendering.
